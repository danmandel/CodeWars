Write a class that, when given a string, will return an uppercase string with each letter shifted forward in the alphabet by however many spots the cipher was initialized to.

For example:

c = CaesarCipher(5); # creates a CipherHelper with a shift of five
c.encode('Codewars') # returns 'HTIJBFWX'
c.decode('BFKKQJX') # returns 'WAFFLES'
If something in the string is not in the alphabet (e.g. punctuation, spaces), simply leave it as is.
